  and Supabase backend

- Add TypeScript setup/verify scripts with full health checks
- Add 5 skills: code-review, devops, enterprise-research, sap-helpers, security-audit
- Add enterprise config with 6 team agents and webhook routing
- Add SAP config with CAP/HANA/BTP-specific teams
- Add docs: RELAY.md (architecture), TEAMS.md (agent setup), CHANNELS.md
